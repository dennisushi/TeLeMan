**Title**: TeLeMan - Teleoperative Legged Manipulator for Explosive Ordnance Disposal

**Project Description**: Human life is invaluable and needs to be protected by all means. Defense and security communities face high risks at a regular base, either this is a result of investigation, monitoring, or patrolling. On the other side, several robotic platforms have shown great capabilities and robustness into operating in challenging environments, such as hazardous ones. Thus, telepresence in robotics has the potential in providing safety solutions to such scenarios. Autonomy though is challenging, and thus teleoperation could be the golden ratio between autonomy and human presence. In this proposal, we aim at developing teleoparative methods, for humans controlling a ground robot from distance to help with Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). We plan on using a legged quadruped robot, embedded with a manipulator and several sensory systems, as well as tele-operative and tele-existence devices from the human operator side. In particular, our goal is to understand the capabilities of such a system for defence and security with the potential to be applied in real-world applications.
