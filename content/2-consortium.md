The **University of Leeds (UoL)** hosts the EPSRC National Facility for Innovative Robotic systems, a £5M capital facility dedicated to the creation and evaluation of real world robotics. The “Real Robotics Lab” led by Prof Richardson has five quadruped robots including ANYmal from ETH Zurich, Laikago, AlienGo and A1 from Unitree Robotics, which will be used as the base legged mobile platform for this project.

The **University College London (UCL)** includes the UCL Robotics Institute that Dr. Kanoulas is a member of and among other facilities and robot equipment, it includes a mobile manipulation robotic platform (MPPL), that will be used in this project for testing the navigation, manipulation, and teleoperation methods for completing the competition tasks.
