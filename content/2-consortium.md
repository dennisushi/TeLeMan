**Dr Chengxu Zhou (PI)** is a Lecturer in Mobile Robotics at the University of Leeds. He obtained his PhD in robotics from the Italian Institute of Technology, where he was responsible for the locomotion of WALK-MAN humanoid robot in DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2015. He has published over 30 papers on dynamic locomotion and balancing control of legged robots. He has won the Best Interactive Paper Award in IEEE Humanoids 2017, and Best Conference Paper Award Finalist in IEEE ARM 2016 and IEEE ROBIO 2019.

**Prof Robert Richardson (co-I)** is a Professor of Robotics in the School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds. As PI and Director of the Â£6M EPSRC National Facility for Innovative Robotic systems, he leads a major EPSRC investment to physically create and evaluate robust autonomous devices. He chairs the EPSRC UK-RAS network, involving 30 universities and over 2500 members. His research tackles a broad range of infrastructure robotics platforms and medical robotic systems. He is also a fellow of the iMechE.

**Dr Dimitrios Kanoulas (co-I)** is Lecturer in Robotics and Computation at the University College London (UCL), Department of Computer Science. Before joining UCL, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology for 5 years and obtained his PhD at Northeastern Univ. in Boston. His research focuses on robot perception, planning, and learning, while he has worked on more than six humanoid/animaloid robots. He has published more than 40 research articles in high-impact robotic journals and conferences, while he has won the Best Interactive Paper Award in IEEE Humanoids 2017 and Best Student Paper Award Finalist in IEEE ICARCV 2018.
